**strsep is a function in string.h used to help parse strings**
- `strsep( <SOURCE>, <DELIMETER> )`
- Locates the first occurrence of any character in the DELIMITER string and replaces it with NULL
- Returns the beginning of the original string
- sets the source string pointer  to point to the index 1 byte after the location of the new NULL
- Since the source variable's value is changed, it must be a pointer to a string.
- To test it out, try the following code:
```c
char line[100] = "woah-this-is-cool";
char *s1 = line;
printf("[%s]\n", strsep( &s1, "-" ));
printf("[%s]\n", s1);
```

Write a function that uses strsep to parse a line of arguments
- Use the following header: `char ** parse_args( char * line );`
- It should take a string with the command line invocation of a program (like `"ls -a -l"`)
    - Note that there is a `" "` between each argument
- Return an array of pointers to each individual argument in the parameter string, that could be used for `execvp()`
- For example, the following code should work (assuming all variables are declared appropriately:
```c
char ** args = parse_args( line );
execvp(args[0], args);
```
- You can make the following assumptions:
  - There is only 1 space between each argument in the original string
  - The original string contains no more than 5 arguments
  - The original string is correctly formatted
