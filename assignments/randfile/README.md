# mks65-randfile
Write a c program with the following features:
1. A function that generates a random number by reading in the correct number of bytes from /dev/random.
2. A main function that:
	1. Populates an array with 10 random numbers generated by your random function (print out each value)
    	- If your program seems to stall at this step, it's possible that your computer [doesn't have enough entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random) and is waiting, you can read from /dev/urandom instead.
  	2. Writes the array to a file
    	- **Do not use a loop** when writing to the file
  	3. Reads that file into a different array
    	- **Do not use a loop** when reading from the file
  	4. Prints out the contents of the second array to verify the random numbers are the same from step 1
- Remember to use good practices, like checking return values for errors
- Also remember to include a makefile that includes a separate run target
