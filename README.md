## Work 02: Construction
For some notes on structs: [https://github.com/mks65/lessons/blob/master/17_struct.md]
- Create a struct that has at least 2 data members, one must be a string.
  - You can provide struct prototypes outside of functions.
  - Don't just combine random things, make it meaningful (like food and price, athlete and associated statistic, Pokemon and something about Pokemon ..)
- Write a function that returns an example of your struct when run.
  - This should not return the same values every time.
- Write a function that prints out variables of your structs type in a reasonable way.
- Write a function that modifies values of your struct's type.
- Write a main function that tests all these things.
  - Have meaningful output.
- DONT FORGET A MAKEFILE
