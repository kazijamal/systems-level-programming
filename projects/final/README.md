# Guess Whom'st've

## by Eric Lau, Kazi Jamal, and Matthew Chan (Period 5)

## Project Description
Guess Whom'st've is a twist on the classic tabletop game by Hasbro: Guess Who. Instead of trying to guess fictional characters based on their appearance, players must guess Stuyvesant High School teachers by asking questions based on their prior knowledge of the school faculty. Two players will each be shown the instructions and then given a randomly selected character The gameplay will consist of two players going back and forth asking questions, analyzing answers to "flip down characters" (eliminate their possibility of being the opponent's character), and finally, guessing the opponent's character.

## Required Libraries
- ncurses: allows for the creation oof "GUI-like" text-based user interfaces
  - install using `apt-get install libncurses5-dev`


## Instructions
1) Run `make` in your terminal to create the files and executables necessary to use the program.
2) Run `./client` in your terminal to begin the program and wait for another player to join. This will be Player 1.
3) Run `./client <ip>` in another terminal or on another machine with the IP address of the machine the first client was created with. This will be Player 2.
4) Player 1 must begin by asking a question to Player 2.
5) Player 2 must answer Player 1's question.
6) Player 1 can flip down the characters that do not align with Player 2's answer by typing in their ID. Once they are done flipping, they can type done.
7) Player 2 must ask a question to Player 1.
8) Player 1 must answer Player 2's question.
9) Player 2 can flip down the characters that do not align with Player 1's answer by typing in their ID. Once they are done flipping, they can type done.
10) During any prompt to ask a question, a player can type g and then guess the opponent's character. Steps 4-9 will repeat until a player successfuly guesses their opponent's character.

## Other Information
Made numerous attempts to use ncurses, but refrained from including it in our final program due to various errors. Our progress using ncurses can be found on the `frontend` branch.
